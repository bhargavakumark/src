This patchset is for using NFS dynamic pseudoroot support with 2.6.32 kernel.
Dynamic pseudoroot is available with 2.6.33 onwards, but if you are stuck with
2.6.32 kernel and cannot upgrade due to any reasons, this patchset will allow
dynamic pseudoroot with 2.6.32, you would also need to upgrade nfs-utils to
1.2.3 or higher (distors would probably be providing 1.2.1 with 2.6.32 kernel)

PATCH 7/7 of the main patchset changes, which is not longer used to communicate
with mountd about the kernel features

include.linux.dynamic.pseudoroot
--------------------------------
defines new flag NFSEXP_V4ROOT that would be used by the kernel for an export
flag to indicate that the export is created for the sake of dynamic pseudoroot
and all content in that directory should not be exposed to user and only content
that is exported in that directory should be shown to user.

also moves nfsd_v4client from vfs.c to common file, which will be used by both
export.c and vfs.c. In the original patchset this would be in vfs.h, the move
of include/linux/nfsd/nfsd.h to fs/nfsd/nfsd.h and fs/nfsd/vfs.h is not done
in 2.6.32, the changes have been done to include/linux/nfsd/nfsd.h

To apply this patch

# cd <kernel-source>/include/linux
# patch -p0 <include.linux.dynamic.pseudoroot

I have not yet added http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.nfs/48982

nfsd.dynamic.pseudoroot
-----------------------
* http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.nfs/29644
  allows exports of symlinks
* http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.nfs/29646
  in readdir hides the entries from pseudoroot directories that are not exported
* http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.nfs/29651
  On V4ROOT exports, only accept filehandles that are the *root* of some
  export.  This allows mountd to allow or deny access to individual paths
  and symlinks on the pseudofilesystem.
  Note that the checks in readdir and lookup are not enough, since a
  malicious host with access to the network could guess filehandles that
  they weren't able to obtain through lookup or readdir.
  moves nfsd_v4client from vfs.c
* http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.nfs/29647, If /A/mount/point/ has 
  filesystem "B" mounted on top of it, and if "A"
  is exported, but not "B", then the nfs server has always returned to the
  client a filehandle for the mountpoint, instead of for the root of "B",
  allowing the client to see the subtree of "A" that would otherwise be
  hidden by B.

  Disable this behavior in the case of V4ROOT exports; we implement the
  path restrictions of V4ROOT exports by treating *every* directory as if
  it were a mountpoint, and allowing traversal *only* if the new directory
  is exported.
* http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.nfs/29648
  We treat every object as a mountpoint and pretend it doesn't exist if
  it isn't exported.

To apply this patch

# cd <kernel-source>/fs
# patch -p0 <nfsd.dynamic.pseudoroot

mountd.dynamic.pseudoroot.always
--------------------------------
There is quite a bit code in nfs-utils that is related to dynamic pseudoroot
in 1.2.3 which may not be available with 1.2.1 (available with most distros
using 2.6.32 kernel), so upgrade to 1.2.3 is necessary. This patch for 1.2.3
and not 1.2.1

* With newer kernels /proc/fs/nfsd/export_features is used by kernel and 
  mountd to communicate about their capabilities. Since this is not available
  with 2.6.32, this patch always enables dynamic pseudoroot in mountd 
  regardless of kernel version. Be careful, not to use this patch on machines
  which do not have the kernel patch for dynamic pseudoroot
* Also fixes http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.nfs/32675, 
  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.nfs/32831 which doesn't seem
  to have made into the tree. Instead using 
  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.nfs/50173 which add no_root_squash
  to pseudoroot based on the actual export and not always

To apply this patch

# cd <nfs-utils-1.2.3-source>
# patch -p0 <mountd.dynamic.pseudoroot.always


nfsd.dynamic.pseudoroot.alternate
---------------------------------
This is an alternate patch to include.linux.dynamic.pseudoroot and 
nfsd.dynamic.pseudoroot which combines both the changes into a single
patch for just the <kernel-source>/fs/nfsd directory. 

In the newer kernel include/linux/nfsd/nfsd.h has been moved into 
fs/nfsd. But the 2.6.32 has it in include/linux/nfsd. This patch creates
a copy of that include/linux/nfsd/nfsd.h in fs/nfsd directory and updates
all files in fs/nfsd to use the local nfsd.h instead of the one in 
include/linux/nfsd. 

Be careful when using this patch, the patch creates a new nfsd.h which 
may or may-not be the same as the kernel you are using. The nfsd.h here
used is based on a 2.6.32.59 kernel. 

To apply this patch

# cd <kernel-source>/include/linux
# patch -p0 <include.linux.dynamic.pseudoroot.alternate
